Notes for my Calculus courses in college, written in Jupyter Notebooks

I can type faster than I can scribble notes in class using my inimitable penmanship (that is not a boast, trust me). 
The idea here is to leverage the formidable scientific and mathematic capabilites Python offers, coupled with the versatility of Markdown and the ease of use of Latex, all combined together in the Jupyter Notebook format, to enhance my study efforts as I progress through the Calculus sequence at my college. 

If this is successful and productive, I will certainly use this method of note-taking for future math, science and engineering courses.
