    "A conic section (or simply conic) can be described as the intersection of a plane\n",
    "and a double-napped cone (i.e. _two cones; one resting on the other, point to point_). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Double-Napped Cone \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes called a __double cone,__ it is formed by revolving the line $y=x$ around the $y$-axis. The point where the two cones meet (at the tips) is called the __vertex.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the image below that __for the four basic conics, the\n",
    "intersecting plane does not pass through the vertex of the cone.__\n",
    "\n",
    "When the plane passes through the vertex, the resulting figure is a degenerate conic, as shown in bottom half of the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed / rigorous __definition of conic sections,__ see George Simmons' _Calculus with Analytic Geometry, Second Edtion._\n",
