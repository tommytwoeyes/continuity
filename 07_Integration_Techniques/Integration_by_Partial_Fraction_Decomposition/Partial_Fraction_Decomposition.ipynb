    "# Partial Fraction Decomposition \n",
    "\n",
    "<p class='lead'>\n",
    "Partial Fraction Decomposition is an algebraic technique used to facilitate integration of Rational Functions.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>It is to Rational Functions what factoring is to Polynomial expressions&mdash;a process for, essentially, \"reverse-engineering\" a (relatively) complex expression.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Using Partial Fraction Decomposition, you're taking apart a rational function (i.e. a fraction), and breaking it down into its constituent parts.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do This?\n",
    "The smaller, more simple fractions that result from partial fraction technique tend to be _much easier_ to integrate than the original rational function you begin with, in most problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Rational Functions\n",
    "To understand how Partial Fraction Decomposition works, it's helpful to see an example of the operation in reverse: adding to simple fractions together to get a more complex rational function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{ Add the fractions: } \\\\ \\frac{1}{x} \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{x^2+4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2+4} = \\frac{1}{x} \\cdot \\frac{(x^2+4)}{(x^2+4)} + \\frac{(x)}{(x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^2+4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= \\frac{x^2+x+4}{x(x^2+4)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class='error'><strong>Note:</strong> this method is incomplete. Need to add steps for decomposing rational functions which include higher-order polynomials.<br/>(e.g. $(x-3)^2, (x-6)^3, (x-2)^4, (x^2+4x+1), (x^2+5x-7)^2$, etc.)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To decompose a rational function, you find the original factors which, added together, made the rational function you need to integrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ In order to use the _Partial Fraction_ technique to write a rational function $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ as the sum of two partial fractions, you must have two things:\n",
    "1. The __degree of $f(x)$ must be less than the degree of $g(x)$__ (i.e. the fraction must be _proper_).\n",
    "2. The __factors of $g(x)$ must be known.__\n",
    "    In theory, any polynomial can be factored. But in practice, it can be very difficult to factor some polynomials.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the degree of the numerator is greater than the denominator, then the fraction isn't _proper_ (the denominator can still be divided into the numerator), so that's what you must do before you can proceed: perform _polynomial long division_ (or synthetic division, if you're into that sort of thing) to reduce the $\\text{ degree of } f(x) < g(x)$ before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "The rational function here can be decomposed and re-written as the sum of two more simple fractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{5x-3}{x^2-2x-3} = \\frac{2}{x+1} + \\frac{3}{x-3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<small><em>You can verify this equation algebraically by using the common denominator $(x+1)(x-3)$ to re-join them, and then simplifying the numerator.</em></small>\n",
    "\n",
    "To integration the partial fractions, just integrate each fraction individually and the add the integrals together.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int \\frac{5x-3}{x^2-2x-3}dx = \\int \\frac{2}{x+1}dx + \\int \\frac{3}{x-3}dx$$\n",
